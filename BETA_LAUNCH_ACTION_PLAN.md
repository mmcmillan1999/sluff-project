# Sluff Card Game - Beta Launch Action Plan

Based on the comprehensive analysis of your codebase, here's a prioritized action plan for transitioning from Alpha to Beta:

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Beta)

### 1. Update Web App Manifest
The `manifest.json` still has default Create React App values:
- Update `short_name` to "Sluff"
- Update `name` to "Sluff Card Game"
- Use your custom logo files instead of default React logos

### 2. Complete TODO Items
Found TODOs that need attention:
- `/backend/src/utils/securityMonitor.js` - Add production logging system
- `/backend/src/data/chatEndpoint.js` - Implement database operations for chat

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Add consistent error boundaries in React components
- Standardize error messages for users
- Implement global error handler for uncaught exceptions

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Implement CAPTCHA for registration
- Add password strength validation
- Review JWT token expiration settings

## ðŸŸ¡ Important Improvements (Should Fix)

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- Add lazy loading for game components
- Implement code splitting for routes
- Optimize image assets (logos are quite large: 2.4MB, 2.0MB)
- Add service worker for offline capabilities

### 2. Mobile Optimization
- Found some media queries but need comprehensive testing
- Ensure touch interactions work smoothly
- Test on various device sizes
- Add viewport meta tags if missing

### 3. Loading States
- Good: Found loading states in some components
- Need: Consistent loading UI across all async operations
- Add skeleton screens for better UX

### 4. Sound System
- Found sound files in `/frontend/public/Sounds/`
- Ensure volume controls are accessible
- Add mute/unmute functionality
- Test sound performance on mobile

## ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Can Add During Beta)

### 1. Analytics Setup
- Add Google Analytics or similar
- Track game events (wins, losses, game duration)
- Monitor user engagement

### 2. Documentation
- Create in-game tutorial
- Add help tooltips
- Write API documentation

### 3. Testing Coverage
- Expand test suite (found good test structure already)
- Add E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing under load

## ðŸ“± App Store Preparation

### 1. Assets Needed
- App icons in required sizes (you have logos, need to resize):
  - iOS: 1024x1024, 180x180, 120x120, etc.
  - Android: 512x512, 192x192, 144x144, etc.
- Screenshots for different device sizes
- App preview video

### 2. Metadata Preparation
- Write compelling app description
- Prepare keywords for ASO
- Create privacy policy and terms of service

### 3. Mobile Wrapper Setup
Recommended approach:
- Use Capacitor (modern, well-maintained)
- Configure for both iOS and Android
- Set up push notifications
- Handle deep linking
