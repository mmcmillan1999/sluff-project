# Insurance Slider Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. **useEffect Dependency Array Problem**
- **Problem**: The  had  in its dependency array, but this array was created fresh on every render
- **Impact**: This caused the  to run on every render, constantly resetting the slider to its default value
- **Fix**: Moved configuration values into a  hook and added an  state to prevent re-initialization

### 2. **State Management Issues** 
- **Problem**: Slider state was being overridden by continuous  execution
- **Impact**: User couldn't move the slider as it would reset immediately
- **Fix**: Added  flag to ensure initialization happens only once per modal open

### 3. **Reference Comparison Problem**
- **Problem**: Arrays are compared by reference in JavaScript, so  was always "new" to React
- **Impact**: Triggered unnecessary re-renders and state resets
- **Fix**: Memoized the entire configuration object using 

## Changes Made:

1. **Added  for configuration** - Prevents unnecessary re-calculation of slider ranges and quick jump values
2. **Added  state** - Ensures slider is only set to default value once when modal opens
3. **Separated initialization and reset logic** - Clear state management between modal open/close cycles
4. **Updated all references** - Use memoized config object throughout component

## Testing:
- Build passes successfully
- Component now properly manages state without interfering with user input
- Slider should move freely and maintain user-selected values

The slider should now work correctly without getting stuck on default values.
