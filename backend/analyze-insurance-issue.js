const CORRECT_INSURANCE_EXPLANATION = `
Insurance System in Sluff (3-player variant):

ROLES:
- BIDDER: The player who won the bid (Solo/Frog/Heart Solo)
- DEFENDERS: The two players opposing the bidder

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Bidder sets a REQUIREMENT (points they demand as insurance)
2. Each defender makes an OFFER (points they'll pay if bidder succeeds)
3. Deal executes when: defender1_offer + defender2_offer >= bidder_requirement

OUTCOMES:
- If bidder WINS the round: Defenders pay their offers to the bidder
- If bidder LOSES the round: Bidder pays the requirement to defenders (split)

STRATEGY FOR DEFENDERS:
- Calculate if bidder is likely to win
- If bidder will likely WIN: Make an offer to limit your losses
- If bidder will likely LOSE: Offer less or nothing
- NEVER refuse a reasonable deal if bidder is strong!

CRITICAL: Refusing insurance when bidder is strong means you lose DOUBLE!
Example: If bidder wants 180 and will win, refusing = -360 points!
         But accepting = only -90 points (your share)
