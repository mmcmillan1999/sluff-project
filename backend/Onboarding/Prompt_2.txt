Onboarding Prompt 2: Code Comprehension & AnalysisGoal:This prompt will test your ability to parse the codebase, connect it to the game's rules, and identify key architectural components.Required Files for Analysis:frontend_context.txtbackend_context.txtSluff Game Rules 3.0.docxAnalysis Steps:First, absorb the code in the context files and show me a tree view of all the .js files so I can confirm you've parsed the structure correctly.Next, using your knowledge of the Sluff Game Rules and the codebase, please identify the primary backend file and function(s) responsible for each of the following critical game mechanics:Handling the "Insurance Phase" negotiation logic.Determining the winner of a single trick during the trick-taking phase.Calculating the final score exchange at the end of a round when a bid succeeds.Then, based on your analysis, which single file appears to contain the main game state machine that orchestrates the overall flow of a round from bidding to scoring?Finally, analyze the component hierarchy starting from App.js. Identify any components that, while present in the codebase, do not appear to be rendered or used by any other part of the application (i.e., they are "orphaned").
