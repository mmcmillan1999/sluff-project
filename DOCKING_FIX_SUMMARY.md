# Card Docking Fix Summary

## Problem
All cards were being timeout docked instead of docking normally when they reached the drop zone. The logs showed:
```
Card docking complete: {success: true, isReturning: false, timeoutDocking: true, ...}
```

## Root Cause
The normal docking check was in the wrong place in the code. It was only checking `if (distance < 5)` at the beginning of `updateThrowPhysics`, which required cards to be within 5 pixels of the exact target position - an extremely precise condition that cards rarely met before the 1.5-second timeout triggered.

## Solution
Added a proper normal docking check that runs BEFORE the timeout check with more reasonable conditions:

```javascript
// Normal docking check - if close, slow, and aligned
if (distToDock < 60 && currentSpeed < 80 && rotationAligned && !card.isReturning) {
    console.log('Normal docking achieved:', {...});
    // Snap to exact position and rotation
    // Complete the docking
}
```

### Docking Conditions:
- **Distance**: Within 60 pixels of dock center (was 5 pixels)
- **Speed**: Below 80 px/s (reasonable for magnetic docking)
- **Rotation**: Within ~8.5 degrees of upright (0°, 90°, 180°, or 270°)
- **Not returning**: Card must be heading to dock, not returning to hand

## Enhanced Features

### 1. Rotation Alignment
- Rotation alignment happens in final 30px approach zone
- Quadratic alignment force for smooth feel
- Preserves angular momentum during flight
- No rotation reversal or acceleration

### 2. Comprehensive Logging
Both normal and timeout docking now log detailed information:
```javascript
console.log('Normal docking achieved:', {
    cardId, distance, speed, rotation, aligned, flightTime
});

console.log('Timeout reached - forcing dock:', {
    cardId, distance, speed, rotation, aligned, wouldDockNormally
});
```

### 3. Clean Completion
- Cards snap to exact dock position when docking normally
- Rotation snaps to nearest 90° angle
- 100ms delay ensures game can process the card
- Proper error handling for callback failures

## Expected Behavior
1. **Fast, accurate throws**: Dock immediately when they enter the zone aligned
2. **Spinning throws**: Continue spinning until final 30px, then align smoothly
3. **Slow/dropped cards**: Get magnetic assist or timeout dock after 1.5s
4. **Off-center throws**: Toilet bowl spiral if intentional, timeout if dropped

## Testing
The new logging will show which docking path each card takes:
- "Normal docking achieved" - Card met all conditions naturally
- "Timeout reached - forcing dock" - Card didn't meet conditions in time

The `wouldDockNormally` flag in timeout logs indicates if the card was close to docking naturally when time ran out.
